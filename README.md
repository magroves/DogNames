PART	1
This part of	the program prompts	the	user	to	enter	a	dog	name	and	responds	with	the	number	of	
dogs	registered	with	the	same	name.	
Here’s	a	sample	run	of	the	program:
Enter a dog’s name?
User types: Zoey
Zoey is registered 23 times.
PART	2
If	the	command	line	argument	is	2, the	program	displays	a	list	of	all	the	dog	names	in	alphabetical	
order.
PART	3
If	the	command	line	argument	is	3,	the	program	presents	two	dog	names	from	the	data	set	and	asks	
the	player	to	guess	which	dog	name	is	more	popular.	The	program	responds	to	the	guess	with	either	
“Yes,	that’s	right.”	or	No	and	the	correct	answer.		
Then,	the	player	is	asked	if	they’d	like	to	continue.	If	they	respond	“Y”, two	new	dog	names	are
presented	to	them.	When	they	decide	to	stop	playing,	a	report	of	the	number	of	correct	guesses	is	
given. Here’s	a	sample	run	of	the	program:
